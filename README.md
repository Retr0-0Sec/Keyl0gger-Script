# Keyl0gger Script for Educational Purposes
This project contains a simple keylogger script that captures keystrokes and sends them to a Discord webhook. It is intended solely for educational purposes to demonstrate how keyloggers work and how data can be captured from input devices.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!
This script is NOT intended for malicious use. Do not use this script without explicit consent from the device owner. Unauthorized use of keylogging software may be illegal and unethical.

Features:
Monitors keyboard input events.
Sends captured keystrokes to a specified Discord webhook.
How It Works:
The script listens for keypress events using the hid library.
Every time a key is pressed, the script sends the keypress data to a specified Discord webhook.
There is a small delay between each keypress to avoid overwhelming the webhook with too many requests in a short time.

Python 3.x
urequests library (for sending HTTP requests)
hid library (for capturing keystrokes)
